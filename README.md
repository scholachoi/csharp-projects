### C# Concepts
A series of Windows Console applications that demonstrate the following.

- [AbstractClassVsInterface](../master/AbstractClassVsInterface.cs) Differences between an abstract class and an interface, in terms of creation and use of each.
- [AccessModifiers](../master/AccessModifiers.cs) Each of these access modifiers: public, protected, internal, private, protected internal.
- [Delegates](../master/Delegates.cs) Creation and use of a delegate and multicast delegate.
- [Enumeration](../master/Enumeration.cs) Creation and use of an enumerable.
- [ExceptionHandling](../master/ExceptionHandling.cs) Handling an exception by writing the important data from the exception to a log file on the local machine. Use of a try/catch/finally block. 
- [NullableTypes](../master/NullableTypes.cs) Creation and use of nullable types.
- [OverloadingOverriding](../master/OverloadingOverriding.cs) The difference between overloading methods and overriding methods, showing each in operation. Creation of a derived class.
- [SealedAndStruct](../master/SealedAndStruct.cs) Creation of a sealed class and creation of a struct.
- [Serialization](../master/Serialization.cs) Serialization of an object - in this case, a BLOB (Binary Large Object) - to a text file. Shows also the retrieval of the object from that file and conversion back to its original form. Use of the keyword ‘this’.
- [ValueVsRef](../master/ValueVsRef.cs) Value types vs. reference types.
